## vocabulary



# CS101: Introduction to Programming
- Comments - Python interprets anything after a # as a comment
- Print() function is used to tell a computer ot talk
- Strings - Blocks of text - can use either single or double quotes "shooters choice"
- Variables - python assigns variables with the ( = ) equals sign
- Errors - python recognizes 2 types of primary errors syntax errors and name errors
  - SyntaxErrors include punctuation, or misplaced commands, or missing parenthesis
  - NameErrors occur when python sees a word it does not recognize - or there is a variable that was never defined
- Numbers - numeric data types -
  - an_int is a whole number
  - a_float is a decimal
- Calculations - python uses standard calcs (+,-, *, /) it will convert math into a float before calculating division
  - a ZeroDivisionError can occur if an attempt to divide by 0 occurs
- Changing Numbers - reassigning the variable will allow the developer to change the value with out adjusting the original amount.
- Adding strings and calculations require the use of a comma to seperate, rather than concatenation

quilt_length = 12

print(quilt_width*quilt_length)

quilt_length = 8

print("I will need", quilt_width * quilt_length ,"squares for my quilt") -->
