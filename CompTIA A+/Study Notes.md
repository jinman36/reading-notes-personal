## CPUs
  
- Objective 3.5
  - What is a CPU?
    - Registers - AX, BX, CX, DX - general purpose registers
      - Pre-fetch
      - Integer Math
      - Long Numbers
      - Cache

- Review
  - central Processing units run programs
  - Every CPU has internal features to process commands
  - Every CPU runs code based on a specific machine language
  - CPUs use pipelines to optimize the processing commands

- Objective 3.5
  - CPU Speeds

- CPU manufacturers - Both speak the same language
  - Intel
  - AMD

- Clock multiplying
  - 95% of the clicks of the clock are internal to the CPU

- **Freeware** CPUID CPU-Z - can detect CPU of the the system and identify the micro-architecture

  - Hyper threading

- Review
  - CPUs have a clock speed, commonly measued in GHz (billions of cycles/sec)
  - CPUs come in primarily two makes: intel and AMD
  - CPUs take a system speed and multiply it to reach the Max CPU speed
  - Single CPUs often have multiple cores

- Objective 3.5
  - Cache

    - Level 1 Cache - runs at the multiplied speed of the CPU
    - Level 2 cache - feeds lvl 1 - bigger but runs slower than clock
    - Level 3 cache - runs around the base motherboard speed - Very large

      - Set association - Higher scope than the A+ exam

- Review
  - CPU caching works between RAM and the CPU
  - Cache is built into the CPU
  - Its common to have three caches in a CPU: L1, L2, and L3

- Objective 1.1
  - 32-bit vs, 64 Bit Processing

    - CPU grabs lines of code from RAM
      - CPU has external data bus that connects throughout motherboard - RAM, etc...
      - MCC - memory controller chip

    - Address bus is a direct connection between the MCC and CPU
      - This will tell the MCC which byte of data that it wants next
- Almost all 64 bit processors can run 32 bit but not the other direction

- **OTE** The correct operating system needs to be installed per the system processing (32b or 64b)

- Modern installation media will query your system and install the correct processor speeds

- 64b gives us more memory

- x86 means 32b

- Review
  - CPUs come in 32-bit and 64bit versions
  - 32 bit CPUs canot address more than 4 gigabytes of memory
  - Operating systems come in both 32 and 64 bit versions
  - Most 64 bit processors can run in 32 bit mode

  - Liquid cooling reduces fan noise

## RAM

- Objective 3.3
  - Install RAM types

- SDRAM - synchronus RAM
  - Runs at the speed of the MB
- DDR SDRAM (DDR ram) - DOuble data rate RAM
- DDR2 - double the speed of the DDR rating

- Double sided RAM - Allows RAM to extend by double

- Channels
  - Dual-Channel Memory

- Review
  - Every stick of RAM has a specific capacity
  - RAM comes in single and double sided versions
  - Motherboards offer multichannel memory
  - RAM should be identical in the same channel

Objective 3.3

- SO-DIMMS - smaller sized RAM

-SPD Chip - Serial Presence Detect

- review
  - Parity and ECC RAM contain extra chips to check for RAM errors
  - ECC Rm is only for motherboards that support it
  - SO-DIMMS are for smaller spaces
  - Almost all RAM has an SPD chip that stores information about the RAM stick
  - Tools like CPU-Z read SPD information

  - BIOS is stored in nonvolatile media, thus called firmware
  - POST routines are built into firmware
  - The system setup utility is also part of the firmware

### Post
  - Objective 3.5

  - POST - power on self test
    - broadcast across the mother board and tells everything to check itself out
      - When it gives a positive response - the cycle will start up
  
  - Beep Codes
    - Primitive types of error codes
  
  - Post cards
    - use these pre anytype of communications available from the POST
    - displays with 2 hexidecimal numbers
    - need to look at the motherboard manual to find the Q-codes/ POST error codes
    
- Review
  - POST runs at Boot, requesting devices to self check
  - POST errors manifest as specific beep codes or display (text) codes
  - POST cards enable testing of 'dead' computers

### Firmware - system setup
- Objective 3.5

  - UEFI - Universal Extensive Firmware Interface (BIOS)
  
  - System Setup - that we can get to from our computer to make changes to our set up
    - access before the system fully boots
