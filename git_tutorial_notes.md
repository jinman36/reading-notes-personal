# Git Tutorial A Comprehensive Guide
- Git uses a DVCS to conquor the vulnerability that a single server CVS can have. A DVCS creates mirrored repositories which allow data to be backed up  easily. These mirrored repositories also allow collaborative work thorough teams because the work is conducted on a local computer, thn merged with repositories on the shared drive.

### Some parts of this tutorial that I learned and want to maintain
- (git stash) - allows you to hid all changes since the last commit for a clean working directory
- (git stash apply) - retrieves hidden changes

### Adding a new remote repository through teh command line
- git remote
    - origin
- git remote add js https://github.com/janesmith/project1
- git push this repo to github

### Fetching
- fetching entails pulling data that you don't have from a remote project
- (git fetch [remote-name])

### Commit mistakes
- (git commit --amend)

### Unstaging a file
- (git reset HEAD index.html)
