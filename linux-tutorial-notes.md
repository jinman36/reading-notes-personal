## intro
- Some tasks are best suited for the GUI - word processing and video editing
- some tasks are better for the command line - data manipulation (reporting) and file management

## Outline
### The command line
- the command line or termial is a text based interface to the system.
- opening the terminal - I'm using windows powershell, then using an Ubantu add on
- The shell, bash - within a terminal we have the shell - this defines how the terminal will beave and looks after running (or executing) commands.
- (echo $SHELL) entered into the command prompt will display the current working shell for the system.

### Shortcuts
- learn and use lots of shortcuts
- (up and down keys) these will let you traverse your history in the command line.

### Basic Navigation
- (pwd) - tells you what your present working directory is. USe this command often, since so many commands rely on you being in the right locations for execution of commands.

- (ls) - list will list out all folders in the directory that you are over
- (ls -l) - list with a long list - adds blocks, file or directory owner, grouping of file and directory owner, file size, modification time, actual name of file or directory.

### Paths
- paths under linux are hierarchial structured.  the top is the root directrtoy and is denoted with a single (/)
- Absolute - specify a location (file or directory) in relation tot he root directory. - these begin with (/)
- relative - specify a location (file or directory) in relation to where we are currently in the system. -will not begin with (/)
- (tilde) ~ - is a shortcut for home directory
- (dot) . - reference to your currentt directory
- (dot dot) .. - refernce to your parent directory

- (cd) - change directory

### Manual Pages

- (/<term>) - within a man page, perform a search for 'term'
- (n) - after performing a search witin a manual page, the the next found item
